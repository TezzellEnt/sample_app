# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

Thanks to Michael Hartl over at http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book for teaching me the first full length rails application I created. This one replicated some functionality of Twitter, with user profiles, microposts, etc.

It was fun & informative.
